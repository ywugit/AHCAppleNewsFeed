The venerable port city—China’s largest by population, with more than 24 million residents as of 2014—is the commercial and financial center of the country, and one of the fastest developing cities in the world. The total GDP of Shanghai has grown to 2.35 trillion yuan, or US $384 billion, in 2014, and continues to grow at a rate of 7% per year. Since the early 1990s, Shanghai has sought to establish itself as a leading global hub for financial services, and it’s achieved that goal through a solid base of industries, including manufacturing (which accounted for 39.9 % of its GDP in 2011) and technology, support from China’s central government, and decades of financial reform. Foreign investment in Shanghai is welcomed with open arms: the establishment of the China (Shanghai) Pilot Free-Trade Zone in 2013, which established an array of economic and social reforms to attract international businesses, brought in more than 1,000 foreign-funded projects worth US $5.4 billion in the first half of 2014 alone.",

As international investors have noted for decades, the Chinese way of conducting business is substantially different from Western methods, and requires sensitivity to the country’s practices and policies. Before opening an office in Shanghai, investors are advised to examine China’s five-year plan, which details the country’s social and economic goals and specifies which industries will receive greater focus to achieve greater financial growth. Drafting your own five-year plan that details your company’s objectives will make government approval for your business more attainable, and establish connections with valuable local resources like the **U.S. Commercial Service** or **U.S.-China Business Council** to help you navigate the often dizzying array of local, provincial, and national government officials that are necessary to getting your business approved.\n\nBe sure to register a trademark for any intellectual property with the Chinese government. Trademarks established in the U.S. do not always remain your property once you cross Chinese borders; in fact, trademarks are usually granted to the first person to register it, regardless of whether that individual actually owns the product or property in question. And do your research when considering a bank; it’s best to find one with a corresponding relationship to the United States to simplify transactions. Consider and develop a digital presence for promotional purposes instead of traditional outlets like newspapers, television, and/or billboards. Online stores are utilized to a greater degree than brick-and-mortar locations, and advertising through social media platforms or other web sites will allow for greater impact with less physical expansion.",

There are a host of social etiquette values in Chinese culture that also carry weight in business interactions. Punctuality and formality are highly valued, while senior representatives require a greater degree of ceremony and respect, especially during introductions. Indirectness is also a significant element of any business transaction: to be respectful, avoid lengthy direct eye contact and too-firm handshakes, and refrain from asking direct questions. A firm *“no”* from a Shanghai business representative is less likely than a polite statement of careful consideration. \n\nDelicacy and tact is also important when hiring staff, especially management. Contracts and employee manuals that detail every aspect of the business and expectations of certain positions are a must-have. Also, when considering a potential employee, weigh the value of their experience over their language skills. The ability to communicate effectively with staff and management is important, but the skills to properly run your business from overseas are far more crucial for your success in the Chinese market.\n\nAt the close of the business day, visitors to Shanghai should also avail themselves of the city’s many attractions. First-timers should pay a visit to The Bund, the city’s lively waterfront and the subject of countless skyline photographs. Shanghai’s most impressive modern architecture, including the Oriental Pearl Tower and Shanghai World Financial Center, can be viewed from across the Huangpu River, while the riverbank itself features shopping and restaurants. \n\nNearby is Nanjing Road, the city’s sprawling shopping district with a wealth of international retailers. The Venetian-inspired Zhujiajiao, with its picturesque canals and bridges, is a short taxi ride from downtown Shanghai. For cultural sights, explore the five-acre, 16th century Yuyuan Garden or Longhua Temple, Shanghai’s oldest and largest place of worship. The Shanghai Museum, too, deserves exploring; its unique architecture contains priceless items and artifacts from all eras in Chinese history. More modern wonders include the Shanghai Maglev, one of the fastest passenger trains in the world, with a peak speed of 270 miles an hour. The twin wonders of the Shanghai skyline are the Shanghai World Financial Center—one of the world’s tallest standing structures at 1,555 feet—and the ornate and immediately identifiable Oriental Pearl Tower, which offers a revolving restaurant, 15 observatory levels, and the Space Module, an observation deck that provides one of the best birds’-eye views of Shanghai’s magnificent design.",

A high ranking means the regulatory environment is more conducive to the startup and operation of a local firm. The rankings are determined by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores on 10 topics, each consisting of several indicators, giving equal weight to each topic. The rankings for all economies are benchmarked to June 2014.\n\nAs this graphic from the World Bank Group indicates, China is gaining on its chief rival, Singapore, as the dominant economic center of Greater China. China, through its largest financial center in Shanghai, has been able to offer to outsiders a wealth of incentives through the Shanghai Free-Trade Zone. These include reduced financial requirements and simplified procedures for establishing a company in China, unrestricted currency exchange (including a 10-year tax-free period), and a list of amenities that includes medical service, telecommunications, ocean freight and international shipping management and banking.\n",
